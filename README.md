# DigitalPointilism

A small one day project I used to experiment with a C++ / Opencv image manipulator based on the artistic technique of [Pointillism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointillism). Please ignore the fact that I mispelled 'Pointillism' everywhere, it's a disaster we will have to live with.

I adapted this into an idea I saw at an art gallery in Italy. It takes a selection of pixels from a source image and splits thier RGB values into seperate points. These images up close look like a scattering of red / green / blue dots but from a far the picture becomes clear (You can simulate this by standing ~20ft from your computer monitor).

In the future if I want to expand on this I think it might be fun to try out different patterns and colors.
